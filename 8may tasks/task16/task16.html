   <h2>here is no international agreement on the v
    ertical extent of sovereign airspace,[5] with suggestions rang
    ing from about 30 km (19 mi)—the extent of the highest aircraft 
    and balloons—to about 160 km (100 mi)—approximately the lowest exte
    nt of short-term stable orbits. (The satellite Lixing-1 had a stable 
    orbit with an apogee of 140 km (87 mi) for three days.)[6] The Fédérat
    ion Aéronautique Internationale has established the Kármán line—at an a
    ltitude of 100 km (62 mi)—as the boundary between the Earth's atmosphere and 
    outer space,[7] while the United States considers anyone who has flown above 80 ki
    lometres (50 mi) to be an astronaut [citation needed]. Indeed, descending Space Shut
    tles flew closer than 80 km (50 mi) over other nations, such as Canada, without requesting p
    ermission first.[8] Nonetheless, both the Kármán line and the U.S. 
    definition are merely working benchmarks, 

    without any real legal authority over matters of national sovereignty.
